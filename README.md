📊 Data Science Playground

Welcome to my Data Science Playground – a collection of projects where I experiment with data, machine learning, and real-world problem solving.
This repository showcases my journey as a Data Scientist & Data Engineer, covering everything from preprocessing and feature engineering to model deployment and visualization.

🚀 Projects Included
🧬 MPEG-G Microbiome Classification (Zindi Challenge)

Built scalable ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM) to classify large genomic datasets.

Automated data ingestion, feature extraction, and pipeline orchestration using Docker + Genie.

Applied explainable AI (SHAP) and deployed a Gradio web app for predictions.

Result: Achieved 86.9% accuracy while handling large-scale, high-dimensional datasets.

🧾 Flu Shot Learning – Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines

Developed predictive ML models using survey datasets.

Applied feature engineering, visualization, and model tuning.

Demonstrated ability to translate raw survey data into actionable health predictions.

🎬 Movie Market Analysis

Created interactive dashboards to analyze box office and streaming data.

Visualized patterns and extracted business insights from large datasets.

Highlighted data storytelling and visualization skills using Python and Tableau.

📱 Mpox Instagram NLP Analysis

Built an NLP pipeline to track misinformation and sentiment trends in social media.

Used LDA topic modeling and VADER sentiment analysis to provide real-time insights.

Showcased unstructured data handling and data streaming, relevant for financial and health monitoring systems.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries: Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow
